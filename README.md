# To-Do List – Simple Task Manager
This project is a simple and interactive To-Do List web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to manage their daily tasks easily – you can add, mark as complete, and delete tasks.
The app also uses your browser’s localStorage to save tasks so they are still available even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## How It Works

### Add a Task

1) Type a task in the input box and click Add

2) The task will appear in the list immediately

3) Mark Task as Complete

4) Click on a task to mark it as done ✅

5) Clicking again will unmark it ⏳

### Delete a Task

1) Click the ❌ (cross) icon next to a task to remove it

2) Automatic Save

Your tasks are stored in localStorage, so they are still there even if you refresh the page

## Technologies Used

HTML – Creates the layout and input fields

CSS – Styles the app with a clean, responsive design

JavaScript – Handles adding, checking, deleting tasks and saving data

 Why This Project

This project is perfect for learning and practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and localStorage in JavaScript.
